# Presentation

Your audience will consist of developers. Therefore, you should create your presentation in a way you would expect from a developer in this position yourself. A good presentation should introduce yourself, and your background, your considerations and approach to your solution, your runnable implementation and finally you present us the source code to your solution. Overall you have 60 minutes for the whole presentation, including Q&A in-between. Please don't present the assignment to our developers, we know it well.

When you do the assessment in our office you'll have all common tools for presentations to your proposal: a 16:10-beamer (1900x1200, HDMI, MiniDP), whiteboard and flipchart. Please inform us in advance if you have special requirements.

In a remote assessment we'll use [BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/) as our video conference software. Please try to visit the room days in advance and test if you are able to do everything you need to do for your presentation. We recommend downloading the desktop client for better performance. If you need to use the browser prefer Chrome for best compatibility.

If you have questions about the challenge, or the organisation of your assessment don't hesitate to ask us.

## Evaluation

We do not rate your solution in terms of right or wrong, but on the basis of objective criteria.
The solution must be written in _Java or Kotlin_ with the Spring framework. You are free to modify everything else that helps you to implement your solution.

**You are free to do the presentation in German or English. But if you choose to do it in German please let us know in advance, so we can prepare the meeting accordingly.**
